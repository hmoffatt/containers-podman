Package: podman
Architecture: amd64
Description: Daemon-less container engine for managing containers, pods and images
 Podman is a container engine for managing pods, containers, and
 container images. It is a standalone tool and it directly manipulates
 containers without the need of a container engine daemon. Podman is able
 to interact with container images create in buildah, cri-o, and skopeo,
 as they all share the same datastore backend.
